Use systemd as default on linux
============================

Cinnamon >= 2.6 select systemd/consolekit at runtime based on gsettings keys.

if linux-any set this as default for all users:
    gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.session screensaver-uses-logind true
    gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.session session-manager-uses-logind true
    gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.session settings-daemon-uses-logind true

We must found the right and better way to do it in debian package.

========================================================
- check if change theme to default d/patch is still correct/needed after muffin rebase
- mimeapps.list specify software that may be not installed in minimal installation,
  without cinnamon meta packages or other users changes, need to be improved or removed
